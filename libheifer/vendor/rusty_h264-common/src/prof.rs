//! Feature-gated decode/encode **stage profiler** — the instrument for perf work.
//!
//! Zero cost unless the `profile` feature is enabled: with it off, [`scope`] is a
//! no-op returning a ZST guard that the optimizer elides entirely, so release
//! builds are byte-identical and the hot path is untouched. With it on, each
//! kernel times itself into an atomic nanosecond bucket; [`dump`] prints the
//! per-stage breakdown.
//!
//! Design mirrors `rff-codec-mp3`'s `encode::prof`. The kernels (`mc_luma`,
//! `reconstruct_4x4`, `decode_residual_block`, the intra predictors, `deblock`)
//! each open a [`scope`] at their top, so every call is captured with one edit.
//! A [`Stage::Total`] scope wraps the whole `decode()` call; the **`mgmt/other`**
//! line is the residue (`Total − Σ stages`) — i.e. per-MB management, MV
//! prediction, nnz/grid bookkeeping, dequant — the bucket we most want to shrink.
//!
//! Caveat for honest reading: the fine-grained buckets (`reconstruct`, `entropy`)
//! are entered millions of times, so each carries ~one `Instant::now()` of timer
//! overhead — their share is mildly inflated and `mgmt/other` mildly deflated.
//! The `(N calls)` column lets you judge ns/call. Measure **throughput** with the
//! `profile` feature OFF (no timer overhead); use this breakdown only to rank
//! stages.
