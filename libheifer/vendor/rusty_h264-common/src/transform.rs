//! H.264 4×4 residual transform and quantization (spec §8.5 / §8.6).
//!
//! H.264 uses a small integer approximation of the DCT — a 4×4 "core" transform
//! whose scaling is folded into the quantizer, so it is exactly invertible in
//! integer arithmetic. This module implements the forward path (encoder:
//! residual → coefficients → quantized levels) and the inverse path (decoder
//! and encoder-reconstruction: levels → coefficients → residual).
//!
//! Correctness here is non-negotiable: the levels we emit are dequantized by
//! every conforming decoder using the exact spec tables below, so the forward
//! quantizer must be the faithful inverse of that process.
