//! CAVLC — Context-Adaptive Variable-Length Coding of residual blocks.
//!
//! This is the entropy coder that actually compresses: a 4×4 block of quantized
//! coefficients (in zig-zag scan order) is coded as `coeff_token` (count +
//! trailing ones), trailing-one signs, the remaining levels, `total_zeros`, and
//! per-coefficient `run_before`. The VLC tables below are the exact H.264 tables
//! (matching the reference decoders our output is validated against).
//!
//! [`encode_residual_block`] and [`decode_residual_block`] are an exact inverse
//! pair, parameterized by `nc` (the neighbor-derived context that selects the
//! `coeff_token` table) and `max_coeff` (16 for a full 4×4, 15 for an AC block,
//! 4 for chroma DC). Neighbor `nc` bookkeeping lives in the macroblock layer.
