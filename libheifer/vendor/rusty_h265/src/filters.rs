/// The shape here is the same lesson as motion compensation: the per-sample
/// work is trivial, so what costs is everything wrapped around it. Three
/// things are hoisted out of the inner loop.
///
/// - **The source copy.** SAO reads deblocked samples while writing filtered
///   ones, so it needs a copy — but one reused buffer, not a fresh clone of
///   every plane of every picture.
/// - **The loop-filter bypass check.** `pcm_loop_filter_disabled_flag` and
///   `cu_transquant_bypass_flag` are rare; when no coding unit in the picture
///   sets either, the check does not belong in a per-sample loop at all.
/// - **Neighbour availability.** Only samples on the one-sample ring at the
///   edge of a coding tree block can have an unusable neighbour. The interior
///   — which is all but `4·cs` of `cs²` samples — needs no check whatsoever.
/// Diagnostic: how much of each plane the narrowed SAO copy actually touches.
