//! Scaling (§8.6.3) and inverse transforms (§8.6.4): the 4/8/16/32-point
//! inverse DCT, the 4x4 inverse DST, transform skip and transquant bypass.
//! Integer only.
//!
//! # Sparsity is the structure that matters here
//!
//! A coded transform block is nearly always sparse: the entropy coder signals
//! the position of the last significant coefficient, and everything past it in
//! scan order is zero. A 32x32 block whose non-zero coefficients live in an
//! 8x8 corner needs an eighth of the arithmetic a dense implementation does,
//! and no amount of vectorisation recovers work that never needed doing.
//!
//! So every entry point takes the non-zero rectangle `(nz_w, nz_h)` that the
//! residual parser observed, and:
//!
//! - **scaling** touches only that rectangle;
//! - the **column pass** runs only over the `nz_w` columns that can be
//!   non-zero, and reads only the `nz_h` rows within them — the rest of the
//!   intermediate is zeroed, not transformed;
//! - the **row pass** reads only the `nz_w` inputs each row can have.
//!
//! For the dense case (`nz_w = nz_h = n`) this is exactly the old arithmetic,
//! so the conformance suite gates both regimes at once.
